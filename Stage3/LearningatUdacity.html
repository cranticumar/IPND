                    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. <b>W</b>orld <b>W</b>ide <b>W</b>eb is collection of HTML files. Multiple HTML files can be linked by hyper links. HTML Consists of 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Text - actual content</li>
                        <li>Markups -  defines the look</li>
                        <li>References to other documents, images, videos or any content</li>

                    </ul>

                    HTML documents is formed by one or more <b>HTML elements</b>. HTML elements are of two types - <b>inline</b> and <b>block</b>. <br>
                    Block HTML elements have a kind of virtual boundary surrounding them.HTML elements are formed by HTML tags. Below is how bold HTML element looks like:<br>
                    <div class="centeredimage">

                    </div>

                    Not all HTML elements have closing tags. There are few elements which has only starting tag.

                    <div class="detail">
                        DOM stands for Document Object Model. HTML is always read in structured manner by all browsers. Each HTML element can host other HTML elements.
                        It is good to have well-organized structure HTML page, which eases the styling and also eases maintenence of blocks.

                <h2 id="css">3. CSS</h2>
                <div class="detail">
                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. As the name suggests, they are meant for styling everything that is viewable on the HTML page. <br>
                    CSS can be linked into HTML in three ways. Here, they are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Writing CSS in another file and link it HTML using <span class="specialwords">link</span> tag</li>
                        <li>Include the code of CSS in same HTML file using <span class="specialwords">style</span> tag</li>
                        <li>Styling it inline using <span class="specialwords">style</span> attribute</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="internaltopic">3.1 Understanding the Cascading</div>
                    <div class="detail">
                        Cascading in CSS is like a tree-branch/ancestor-descendant structure. I would like to use same example that Udacity coach taught me - hierarchial law. Country law is applicable to all states, state law applies to all cities, your house rules applies to all people in the house. Similarly styling also maintains similar heirarchy. Rules to <span class="specialwords">body</span> tag will apply to all <span class="specialwords">div</span> tags under it. Individual <span class="specialwords">div</span> can have its own styling. Styles of <span class="specialwords">body</span> and <span class="specialwords">div</span> will have impact on <span class="specialwords">span</span> tag used within. This feature/property of CSS is called <span class="specialwords">inheritance</span>.<br>
                        There are Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, height, and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.

                    <div class="detail">
                        Apply style to HTML elements by mentioning html element name with styling attributes and values in flower braces <span class="specialwords">h2 {color: blue}</span><br>
                        Apply style to multiple HTML elements using classes. For e.g. In this page, all topic headings belong to same Class, so that is the reason, they all look blue. Syle a Class by pre-fixing period infront of class name <span class="specialwords">.headings {color: blue}</span><br>
                        Apply to style to specific element using id. For example, all the description in this page has same styling except for the content in <b>About me</b> section. It has some additional styling. It leaves some space for image to the right. Any special styling to spefic element/box is done by IDs.
                        Style using ID in CSS as <span class="specialwords">#abtme {max-width: 95%}</span><br><br>

                <div class="detail">
                    <b>Below are just few tips to make your life easier while coding in HTML and CSS:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alwys divide into as many boxes as you can, but be litle cautious</li>
                        <li>Use Classes to avoid repetition. Benefits of avoiding repetition are as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Less coding and less code</li>
                                <li>Lesser size of HTML files, computer download pages from servers to show webpages when you browse, it will save money if you have lesser size</li>
                                <li>Saves alot of time</li>
                                <li>Less code inturn leads to less typing, which means less human prone errors. Unlike Human brains, Computer cannot relate to context and understand it, if they are spelling mistakes</li>
                                <li>If you keep styling repeatedly, you might have your style code spread over in lot of places rather than at one place. It might waste time while debugging and also it might like unorganized</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Main good intendation and hierarchy, so that it is readable to you and others</li>
                        <li>Always visualize the design before coding</li>
                        <li>Never use IDs the way you use Classes, they lead to many issues</li>
                        <li>Use Developer tools to change the Style on the go.</li>
                        <li>Google, W3Schools are best references</li>
                        <li>Make your Class and ID names meaningful, so that it is easy for you to refer back in the future.</li>

                <h2 id="pl">4. Python</h2>
                <div class="detail">
                    <b>Before really understanding what python is, we shall try to understand what a programming language is.</b>
                    <div class="internaltopic">4.1 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</div>
                    <div class="detail">
                        Language is basically used for communication. An example of language is English. But if we start talking to computer in general languages, it would take pages to do a small task.<br>
                        Another greater problem is ambiguity present in generally spoken languages, which computers might misinterpret. <br>
                        So, all languages that we can talk to computers are made of strict grammar called Syntaxes (or) Instructions. <br>
                        So Programming Language is nothing but a set of instructions, that a computer can understand. <br>
                        Different Programming Languages are - Assembly Level Language, C, C Plus Plus, Java, Python, Perl, HTML and so on. <br><br>
                        <b>One liners about each type of languages:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assembly Level Languages - Close to hardware, instructions are straight to hardware - may take many instrcutions to complete a task</li>
                            <li>Compiler based Languages - C, C PLUS PLUS - Basic of all languages - Needs to be compiled from platform to platform</li>
                            <li>Byte Code based Languages - Java, Python - These languages form byte code which runs on virtual platform, once this virtual platform is available, it can run on any platform. This virtual platform will convert the instructions in such a way that underlying platform can understand</li>
                            <li>Interpreter based Languages - They get interpreted on the go.</li>
                            <li>Markup Languages/Style Languages - they are used for looks/styling</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Processor processes the instructions provided. Fastness of the processor depends on its number of cycles that it can clock in a second (or) number of instructions that can process in a second.
                    </div>
                    <div class="internaltopic">4.2 PYTHON</div>
                    <div class="detail">
                        Python is modern programming language. It is very efficient. Difference between C-Style and Python is that Python do not have flower braces to tell about where a block is starting and ending. It strictly depends on intendation. So intendation is very important in Python compared to any other language. If there are any set of instructions that needs to be repeated, its better to be written as procedure or function. Syntax for defining a procedure in Python is <span class="specialwords">def</span>. Python cam store data in differnt types - Data types.<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>strings - str</li>
                            <li>lists - list</li>
                            <li>dictionary - dict</li>
                        </ul>
                        Another most common and important thing is "assignment". Everyone is human, but everyone has name. There can be many strings, but to call that string for re-use, it needs to be assigned to a variable. Please avoid using syntax itself as variable. Anything can be assigned to a variable by using equals operator. (=)
                    </div>
                    <div class="internaltopic">4.3 STRINGS</div>
                    <div class="detail">
                        Strings are immutable datatype, once assigned cannot be altered, but can be re-assigned. Strings are sequence of characters. Each character can be accessed by indices, which range from 0 to one less than length of the string. Length of the string is nothing but number of characters inside the string. Strings will be assigned to variable with characters mentioned within single quotes or double quotes based on situation<br>
                        <br>
                        For example <span class="specialwords">example = "I am String"</span> <br>
                        Length of the example can be found by <span class="specialwords">len(example)</span>, which will be 11 in this case. <br>
                        Induvidual characters (or) multiple characters can be accessed by using indices:
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="specialwords">example[0]</span> will return I</li>
                            <li><span class="specialwords">example[10]</span> will return g</li>
                            <li><span class="specialwords">example[0:9] or example[:9]</span> will return "I am Strin"</li>
                            <li><span class="specialwords">example[1:9]</span> will return " am Strin"</li>
                            <li><span class="specialwords">example[11]</span> will return an error</li>
                            <li><span class="specialwords">example[-1]</span> will also return "g". This is called reverse access, which can be done by using negative indices</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        To find part of the string or character in a string, there is built-in function in String. That is <span class="specialwords">find()</span>. <span class="specialwords">find()</span> accepts two inputs at the maximum. First input is "character(s)" to find in mother string and second input is index offset from where the search has to be started. Output would be the index, if the character(s) are found or -1 if not found. It also returns only first instance of occurance from the point of search.<br>
                        <span class="specialwords">example.find('i', 1)</span> will return 8
                    </div>
                    <div class="internaltopic">4.3 LISTS</div>
                    <div class="detail">
                        As you have already gone through Strings, I would like to explain lists in comparison with strings. Unlike Strings, Lists are mutable datatype. As name specifies the meaning, it is list or an array or collection of items. Each induvidually can again be of different datatypes. There is no find function for Lists in Python. To find items in list, there are other ways which you will read in sections.<br>
                        Here is how list looks like and is assigned, <span class="specialwords">li = [1, 'abc', ['def', 4]]</span>
                        <br>
                        Like Strings, List items also are accessed by using indices.
                        <ul>
                            <li>li[0] will return 1</li>
                            <li>li[1] will return 'abc'</li>
                            <li>li[2] will return list - ['def', 4]</li>
                            <li>li[2][0] will return 'def'</li>
                            <li>li[2][2] will return IndexError</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Easy way to check if an item is list or not is by <span class="specialwords">item in list</span>. If item exists, it will return True else False.<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="specialwords">1 in li</span>will return True (True is Boolean 1)</li>
                            <li><span class="specialwords">['def', 4] in li</span>will return True (True is Boolean 1)</li>
                            <li><span class="specialwords">['def', 10] in li</span>will return False (True is Boolean 0)</li>

                        You can alter items of the list by using their indices, li[0] = 10, now li will be li = [10, 'abc', ['def', 4]]. One can add new items also using the same, but append is preferred for adding new items
                        <br>
                        One can use append items to the list using append function. li.append(15), now li will be [10, 'abc', ['def', 4], 15]

                    <div class="detail">
                        I will describe differences between List and Dictionary here. As name suggests, it is mapping of elements. Like a language dictionary, where you have a word and meaning, here we have key and value. Lists access their elements by indices, dictionaries access by using their keys, hence might return key errors in case if unknown/undefined key is accessed. <br><br>
                        <span class="specialwords">d = {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2}</span>
                        <br>
                        An item can be added to dictionary by <span class="specialwords">d['key3'] = 3</span> (or) by using update function <span class="specialwords">d.update({'key4': 4})</span>
                        <br><br>
                        Search can done using keys, <span class="specialwords">'key1' in d</span> will return True if 'key1' exists in d, else False

                        <ul>
                            <li>All basic arthematic operations can be done by using +, - , * (multiply), / (quotient), % (reminder/modulus)</li>
                            <li>Comparison operators are == (equals), =< (less than or equals) and >= (greater than equals)</li>
                            <li>Using + operator on two strings/lists will result in concatenation, does not work on dictionaries</li>
                            <li>Using * operator on String/Dictionary will append by respective number of times</li>
                            <li>Expression syntax is "Expression/variable operator Expression/variable e.g. 2 > 3</li>

                        Conditional blocks - as name says all, a block of code is executed based of conditions result. Check out of if-else in python examples in Google (or) check out <span class="specialwords">html_generator.py</span> in the git repository

                    <div class="detail">
                        As you have gone through if-else conditional blocks, I will make a comparisions to describe what loops are and why they are useful. Main disadvantage for if-else blocks are they can execute the code only once and then exist, say for example you want to repeat same operations on all items in list, you might want loop same logic on all items, which is not possible through if-else blocks solely. Refer to examples in git repository (inside Python folder). There are two ways of loops - <span class="specialwords">for</span> and <span class="specialwords">while</span>. For loops edge over the while loops, as you might need an extra variable to traverse through lists, as index is used in while loop, which needs to incremented as we execute, which is not required in for loops. There are cases where you might need a variable in both for and while loops - e.g. count number of times, the code has been looped.

                    <div class="internaltopic">4.5 Procedures (or) Functions</div>
                    <div class="detail">
                        Procedure or functions are generally written to avoid repetition. Say for example you have 10 lists and you want to check if a string exists in any of the 10 lists or not. We can write a logical code to search for a string in one list and then put that code in one function, then call that function by passing each list as an input and also string to search as another input.<br><br>

                            <li>Always break your problem in small pieces</li>
                            <li>Implement smaller logics and then optimize them</li>
                            <li>Test them as and when you write and complete small blocks of code</li>
                            <li>Think and Develop test data, so that you can access/test all lines of code by using your test inputs</li>
                            <li>Use traceback to debug it</li>
                            <li>Go through python documentation (mentioned in TIPS section) for more details on any area of python while debugging</li>
